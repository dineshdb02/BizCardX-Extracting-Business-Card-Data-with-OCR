# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR




Description
BizCardX is a Streamlit application designed to streamline the process of extracting relevant information from business cards using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. Users can upload an image of a business card, and the application will extract key details such as the company name, card holder name, designation, contact information, and address. The extracted information is displayed in a clean and organized manner within the application's graphical user interface (GUI).

Additionally, BizCardX allows users to save the extracted information into a database along with the uploaded business card image. This database can store multiple entries, each containing its own business card image and extracted information. Users can also perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the stored data directly through the Streamlit UI.

Technologies:

OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Streamlit GUI (Graphical User Interface)
SQL (Structured Query Language) for database management
Data Extraction techniques
Problem Statement
The project addresses the challenge of efficiently extracting relevant information from business cards. Traditionally, manually transcribing information from business cards can be time-consuming and prone to errors. BizCardX automates this process by leveraging OCR technology, providing users with a convenient and accurate way to digitize business card data.

Approach

Install Required Packages: Set up Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a suitable database management system such as SQLite or MySQL.

Design User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, guiding users through the process of uploading business card images and extracting information. Utilize widgets like file uploaders, buttons, and text boxes for interaction.

Implement OCR and Image Processing: Utilize easyOCR to extract relevant information from uploaded business card images. Apply image processing techniques like resizing and thresholding to enhance OCR accuracy.

Display Extracted Information: Present the extracted information in a structured format within the Streamlit GUI, using elements like tables and text boxes for clarity.

Database Integration: Implement database functionality using SQL to store extracted information and associated images. Enable CRUD operations for managing stored data.

Testing and Improvement: Thoroughly test the application to ensure functionality and reliability. Continuously enhance the application by adding features, optimizing code, and addressing bugs.

Results

BizCardX delivers a streamlined solution for extracting and managing business card information. Users can easily upload images, extract relevant data, and store it in a database for future reference. The intuitive user interface ensures a seamless experience, while the underlying OCR and database functionality provide accuracy and efficiency.

This project showcases the integration of various technologies, including OCR, GUI development, and database management, to create a valuable tool for businesses and individuals alike. By digitizing business card information, BizCardX contributes to improved organization and productivity in managing contact details.
